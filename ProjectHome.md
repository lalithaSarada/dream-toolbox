DREAM (Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis) is a Matlab toolbox based on the implementation of the algorithm developed by Jasper Vrugt (J.A. Vrugt et al, Accelerating Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation by differential evolution with self-adaptive randomized subspace sampling). It runs multiple different chains simultaneously for global exploration, and automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution using differential evolution. The algorithm maintains detailed balance and ergodicity and works well and efficient for a  large range of problems, especially in the presence of high-dimensionality and multimodality.
